# File Organization Second Project
Our class is **Turma A**

## Project Division

### Almost implemented (from previous project)
1. Interface and data display
2. Reading input file and treating it
3. 

### To be implemented
1. Generate the 3 output files (with Worst, Best or First-fit)

2. Create one primary index **per output file** by the field *ticket*
  - Note here that each file has it index (files 1, 2, 3 have respective 
    indexes 1, 2 and 3). Also, index files MUST be generated IMMEDIATLY AFTER
    the output files. e.g: file 1 generated -> index 1 generated -> file 2 
    generated -> index 2 generated...
    
3. Logic remotion: user should type a value and we should
  - Search the record in **each of the 3 files USING THE INDEX FILES**.
  - **Logic remove** the record (See FAQ for explaining).
  - Physically remove the record **from the index files** (See FAQ).
  - Display a message saying whether it was or not successfully removed.

## File Structuring
  The file structure will be identical as the first project. Fixed-size
  fields should be grouped before variable ones following the order:
  
**FIXED**

  1. ticket
  2. documento
  3. dataHoraCadastro
  4. dataHoraAtualiza

**VARIABLE**

  5. dominio
  6. nome
  7. cidade
  8. uf
  

**Fixed fields come all together on the beginning of the record**,
followed by the variable fields.

Fixed fields do not need any type of indicators, they are always there. 
Variable fields should have **size indicators** before them. 
Records should have **delimiters** at the end of them.

## FAQ

**Q: My question isn't answered here, what now?**

- A: Check the slides. Seriously, check it 100 times.



**Q: Checked 100 times, what now?!?!**

- A: Check 1000 times.



**Q: My PC exploded cuz I checked the slides too much.**

- A: Let's ask the teacher or her intern.



**Q: Should I put the fields with fixed size together?**

- A: Yes. Put them at the beginning of the record.



**Q: But all the files have fixed number of fields.**

- A: Yea we know, just "pretend" they have not unless it is 
'fixed number of fields' and we'll get 10...



**Q: What can be used from the first project?**

- A: It seems all we've done wrong was assuming that all files
have fixed number of fields per record, fixing that should make
the previous code acceptable.



**Q: PDF page 3 says: "note that the files generated by 'functionality 2' 
will be equal. What is 'functionality 2'?"**
- A: 



**Q: PDF page 3 says: "note that the index files generated by 'functionality 3' 
will be equal. What is 'functionality 3'?**
- A:



**Q: What is and how to perform a *logic remotion*?**
- A:



**Q: In the *logic remotion*, should I remove the record from all the files
  and from all the index files?**
- A:
